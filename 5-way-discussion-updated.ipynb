The topic of discussion will be adding a new API to \"CpqBuddy\" to notify external systems when an open quote is in progress for a specific customer. I'll go around the room, and each of you can share your initial thoughts on this requirement. Let's start with Krishna - what are your initial thoughts as our Architect?\n",
      "\n",
      "Krishna: Implementing this new API for notifications will involve extending our current API Gateway configuration to accommodate this new endpoint. Additionally, we need to ensure that this API complies with our existing authentication and authorization mechanisms using OAuth2.0. In terms of data handling, since we're notifying external systems about open quotes, depending on the data volume and frequency, we may need to consider if our current infrastructure can handle the increased load or if scaling adjustments are necessary. Furthermore, the notification mechanism should be designed to ensure data consistency and reliability in how the information is communicated to these external systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sudeep: From a system design perspective, we need to assess the impact of this new API on our existing architecture. We need to define the exact data contract between CpqBuddy and the external systems. The notification API will need to query the MongoDB database to identify relevant quote information, so we should evaluate the performance implications of these queries. We need to consider the design of the notification mechanism, whether it will be synchronous or asynchronous, and how it will handle failures. We should also evaluate the need for a message queue to ensure reliable delivery of notifications. The existing authentication and authorization mechanisms can be extended to this new API.\n",

      "Debojit: Based on the inputs from Krishna and Sudeep, implementing this notification API is feasible with our existing tech stack of Java Spring Boot, MongoDB, and API Gateway with OAuth2.0. Here's my assessment of the development tasks and timeline:\n",
      "\n",
      "Tasks breakdown:\n",
      "1. Create new REST endpoint in Spring Boot API (2 days)\n",
      "2. Implement MongoDB query logic for open quote status (2 days)\n",
      "3. Develop notification mechanism using message queue (3 days)\n",
      "4. Add OAuth2.0 security configuration for the new endpoint (1 day)\n",
      "5. Write unit tests and integration tests (2 days)\n",
      "6. API documentation and swagger updates (1 day)\n",
      "\n",
      "Total timeline: 11 working days\n",
      "\n",
      "Key considerations:\n",
      "- We'll need to ensure proper error handling and retry mechanisms\n",
      "- Performance testing will be crucial given the database queries involved\n",
      "- Proper logging needs to be implemented for troubleshooting\n",
      "- We should include circuit breakers to handle downstream system failures\n",
      "\n",
      "Would recommend a detailed technical design discussion before we begin implementation. Do you need any clarification on the development aspects?\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip: Thank Debojit for the comprehensive breakdown of tasks and timeline. It's good to see that you've considered various technical factors, such as performance testing and error handling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Devleen: To start with, I'd like to add a non-technical aspect - will we have any support or liaison from the business stakeholders to help us understand their expectations for this API? As Product Owner, my primary stakeholder will be them, but it would be beneficial to ensure we're meeting their requirements accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Krishna: That's a valid point, Devleen. We should reach out to them and confirm that understanding of the new API's functionality aligns with our technical design discussions to ensure we're building what they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip: Agreed. Let's add this to our scope - get confirmation from stakeholders on their expectations for the notification mechanism and performance characteristics. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sudeep: Before we finalize any timelines or start implementation, have we discussed how this new API will integrate with our existing monitoring tools? How can we ensure that notifications are received in a timely manner?\n",
      "\n",
      "Debojit: We will consider integration with the existing monitoring tools but need to schedule it alongside initial API development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Devleen: Thank you for the thorough insights, team. However, considering our current sprint commitments, where we have a P2 issue taking 5 days and a P3 issue taking 3 days, we have fully utilized our 10 days of available development bandwidth. Debojit's estimate for this new API comes up to 11 days, which means we cannot accommodate this requirement within the current sprint without impacting our ongoing commitments. \n",
      "\n",
      "We should prioritize this requirement for the next sprint and confirm back to Philip about the need to reschedule it.  END CALL\n",
